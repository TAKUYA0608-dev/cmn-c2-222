# CMN-C2-222 — Enterprise AI-Ready Document-Ingestion Design-Advisory Q&A Agent

> **Category**: Cat 2 (domain workflow (a job to be done))
> **Industry**: Common (industry-agnostic)

## Overview

Given a design question such as "How should we ingest finance customer records into an AI knowledge base — what about personal-data rules and sandboxing?", the agent returns a design proposal: it normalises the question into industry, document-type, regulation and environment slots, tags sensitivity and regulations with a deterministic keyword map, retrieves matching design-guidance passages, and assembles a Markdown proposal with a converter invocation pattern, a sandbox specification, a chunking strategy and clause-level citations. The proposal structure, sandbox controls, chunking guidance and citations are rule-based; an LLM, if configured, only writes the narrative, and without one the narrative is omitted. A question that no passage grounds receives an insufficient-grounding answer instead of an invented architecture, uncited answers are not published, sensitive values are redacted, and every answer carries a legal disclaimer. The knowledge base shipped here is a small sample citing Japanese personal-data and electronic-bookkeeping rules — replace it with your own.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | 3.11 or later (`requires-python = ">=3.11"`) |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent raises
`PlatformRequired` during graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and operational documentation
```

See `docs/02_design.md` for the design and `docs/03_test_spec.md` for the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
